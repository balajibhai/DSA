I would like to explain about the time that I was very busy. It happened some
six years ago where I was working in Zoho Corporation. I was a software
developer and I had to build some backend APIs. That was my task and I was given
some three different features to be delivered.

There was a product launch for our product Zoho Creator 5.0. From 4.0 they are
moving it to 5.0. So I had to work day and night in order to deliver that
feature on time. There was a deadline that the product has to be launched by
Monday morning.

We were working on some other integration with the mobile applications as well
on Friday evening. So me and the product owner, we both were working for over 24
hours to build that app. The APIs that we have delivered already to the mobile
Android application that has to be approved by Google and has to be sent on
Monday morning for the launch.

We have given some other wrong parameters so that we cannot change those
parameters as well once we have given to Google. Google team has approved and it
will take some 15 days for them to approve. So it was a critical time that
whatever we have sent to Google to approve and whatever has got approved that
has to work on product launch on Monday morning.

So me and the product owner, we both were trying to solve this problem. We took
some 20 hours to solve it and send it to all the servers. That was the time when
I was very very busy and I have never done anything.

I would like to explain you about the activity which I enjoyed most in my
primary school, which is yoga. I was very young and I never showed any interest
in my studies. And whenever they ask me about any of my academic activities, I
will always say that I like yoga and karate. I never looked at my body as a tool
before all these yoga classes.

And the most enjoyable activity for me is yoga. And there was a teacher who
usually teaches us bi-weekly. And every day whenever she arrives, I was most
delighted because there will be some three hours session. And she will give us
so many different ways to perform some asanas, like the postures. And I like
doing it with my friends and I was the one who will be able to do exactly as my
teacher does.

And I started enjoying the benefits of it and I understood that keeping our body
in the right condition is how we will be able to be at peace and enjoy this
life. So that was my very enjoyable activity in my childhood.

And I still enjoy roaming around with my friends and performing some karate and
kung fu stunts. But still if you ask me, I will always say that yoga is my
favorite activity even today. Thank you.

The activity that made me feel tired is playing squash. I had never played squash in my life until I went to Canada and one of my roommates helped in explaining to me how the squash game works. He took me to the gym nearby and I played squash for the first time.
There were multiple rules:
1. The ball has to bounce twice on the ground and on the wall.
2. There will be two players who will be put inside one glass box and they can play.
3. If any one of the persons is losing the ball, then the other person scores a point.
We played for some 30 minutes and it involved multiple running, chasing the ball, and hitting the ball with some effort. Since I have never played squash, this was the first time and it felt like I was exhausted. I have played basketball and football in my childhood, and after 15 years, I am playing squash. Between these years, I have never played any sports, so I was very exhausted at that time. This caused me some leg cramps as well, and I had to go to the hospital for one day, two days I think, and that was a funny moment. I thought I am aged.

The person I admire the most is my manager Benjamin Pinford. I recently moved to the current company that I am working for. I have been in this company for two and a half years. I was put into a different team and I was more enthusiastic about joining the framework team. I talked to Benjamin Pinford who is the project manager for the framework team. So I had a chat with him and he agreed that once my role, whatever was assigned to me in the previous team, was completed, I can come back to this team.
The soft and managerial decisions that Benjamin has taken are very crucial. I asked him that I wanted an on-site opportunity and he was so keen that he went through all the HR process and all the other stuff to make this happen. Since I was in the company for only one and a half years, giving an on-site opportunity to a colleague on a very short notice is very remarkable. If I am giving any feedback, then those will definitely be done inside the team.
Work allocation is also a place where he shines well. He is a person who can handle both the project management skills and the development as well. I would like to be such a person rather than just looking at only the developmental activities alone. Thank you.

One area of science that interested me is developmental biology. I came through this video on YouTube where they explained about developmental biology and I was so excited to understand finally that these guys have cracked something that we have never thought about in our entire human history.
If we are passing some electrical signals to a stem cell, then it can convert it into a frog that can have two heads or six legs. We can change anything that we want from this single cell and bring out an organism that is completely different from what the original DNA is. This is so exciting because right now there are multiple accidents where we are losing some of the organs that are very critical for human functioning.
If we are able to create these organs instead of harvesting from some other people, we can directly go ahead and have a laboratory where we will be creating these organs based on the electrical signals that we will be sending to the cells. That will help our humanity grow to the next level.
Whatever investments that are needed, many big companies are investing in this startup to give this idea a new face in biology, where harvesting these organs is very easy and affordable, and it is helpful for humanity as well. So not only humanity, maybe we can say that it will help all the organisms in the world.
I would like to talk about a series which had a great impact on me. The series is called Breaking Bad and it is about a teacher who works with one of his students and becomes a very big meth drug lord in the USA. The teacher had cancer and he was about to die, and on the brink of his life, he was able to use his chemistry to create a drug which is extremely pure and gives very high hormones to the users.
So he had to fight with all the other drug lords and create a very big business which can be listed in NASDAQ. I like the author, the direction the story was projected, and the main character was a very strong one. He has acted in a way that he won so many Oscars for his famous dialogues and his acting.
I still remember many dialogues and I would use them frequently in my daily life as well whenever I was able to tease my family or my friends. If I have removed my hair, I would look just like him and it was very funny at one point that we both were able to look just like that. He was 51 years old and I was just 27, and we both looked similar. That was an insult to me, but it was a funny thing.One area of science that interested me is developmental biology.

I would like to describe you about the time when I was very busy in my life. It was six years ago when I was working with Zoho Corporation and I had to work on all the servers, which will be some boxes that will give the data to the users. We had to send these in on the application code, the app for Android, to Google, and they have reviewed it.
There was some other issue where the back-end servers are not compatible with whatever we have given to the Play Store in Google. Even in two days, there was a major release for the creator application, which is the one that I was working for in the product that I had worked for. I had to contact the product manager and all the other higher officials and inform them that there is a problem that we have to postpone the release.
Since I was the person responsible for developing this, I had to work for three days straight with no sleep and food, and it was very hectic. I was given a great report at the end for the job that I have done, and the release commenced as we have planned earlier.
Within two days, me and the product owner, manager, and a few of my developers, everybody was working tirelessly on this project, and we were able to complete this in the deadline. But still, I have never worked that intensely in my life afterwards until now, and I still look forward to any such encounters. Thank you.
I'm going to describe about a time where I changed my opinion. I don't know why I held this opinion but I have never taken any care about my physical health so far in my life. Every time I get sick or get any issues, bodily issues, it will always be resolved once I go to my family, to my parents. I always keep that responsibility, give that responsibility to my dad and my mother so I have never given any thought to it.
Once I was alone and I went to work in a company and I had to stay alone. At that time I was hit with some stomach pain and headache and some vomiting as well and then I realized that that is the time that I had to take care of myself and taking care of my family and all the other things comes secondary and looking at my own health is the most primary thing that I can do and I started having an internal transformation where I instead of looking at any other gain from outside the environments I always look at my health, personal health and hygiene and maintain my body in a very good manner.
I will always go to gym from that time and take care of my physical health as the most treasured one rather than looking at any other goals in my life. I keep my personal health as the primary goal of my life. Thank you.
I'm going to explain about an interesting conversation that I had with my roommate. I was sent on site last year and I had to stay alone for a year and I left my family and only conversation that I had with the other person is this roommate.
My father has diabetes and he was suffering from many side effects of it and I was researching on how to get him out of diabetes and give him a healthy life. I was having a conversation with this roommate where his father as well has the same problem and he was using some Ayurvedic medicine called Sirkurjan, which is a herbal plant where we should get all the leaves and then crush it and make juice out of it and drink this juice every morning for 15 days. Once we do this, the diabetes level will get reduced from 10 to 6 actually.
I was hesitant at the start to whether to try this or not and I advised my father to do the same thing for a day and see what happens. He tried for 3 days and he saw some improvement and he continued for the next 15 days. Right now his diabetes level is very low and it is in control actually and he is healthy.
So I am very happy that I had this conversation with this stranger actually and now a great friend and I am still grateful for this conversation and happy that I had it. Thank you.
I would like to talk to you about a situation where he was forced to stay in a covered place. Usually in India, there are some great festivals like Diwali and Pongal where people usually buy clothes and all the cooking materials and all the new stuff that they want to be kept in the family. And this happens at these festival times.
I was stuck in one of such occasions. I was asked to go to Teenagar, which is a very busy city in Chennai, and asked to buy all these puja items that I have to get for Pongal. I had to travel like two hours in a car with my family and stay there for over 3-4 hours.
I was trying to find the car parking and it was very difficult. It was very hectic to find the car parking place. So I had to park my car near a railway station and I was worried the whole time that whether the car will be stolen or not.
I was having my daughter, who is 2 and a half years old, and I had to carry her the whole time. My wife and my mother were purchasing and finding out all these items and shops was very difficult. We almost toppled down in one of the places.I'm going to explain about an interesting conversation that I had with my roommate.

I would like to talk about a very difficult decision I have taken in my life. I was asked to come abroad from my company regarding one of the client's work. And I had to choose whether I have to leave my family behind and go work for some company in a distant land or to stay here with my family and enjoy life.
As I was very in need of money, I had to convince my family and leave to work for the company. And it was a very difficult decision for me because I have never left my family till that point. And I have a daughter who is 2 years old and I cannot miss her touch. And it was a very tough situation where I made the call to move abroad.
And I am actually happy today that I was able to withstand all these things and cook and eat myself all alone in a distant land. But thinking of these situations, if you ask me that whether I will be taking the same decision today, I would say that I will definitely take the same decision. Because I can see the most supporting and positive things coming out of it right now.
But when I took that decision, it was very vague belief that it will turn out to be good. And that actually turned out to be good. I am happy today and I still can meet my daughter now. So, I am happy for that. Thank you.
I would like to talk about the most important supporting movie for me, which is Oppenheimer. I was sent to Canada regarding my work and I was alone from my home. I really wished to escape that scenario by looking at some movie which helped me forget about where my real situation is. I was anticipating that I'll be getting a great output from Christopher Nolan, the director of the movie, and Hans Zimmer, the music director of the movie. They had great reputation and I was looking around for this movie. I have watched all the movies given by these two people and I still could not believe that they made a movie just to project some historical characters and not give any hidden meaning or any, I don't know, maybe Christopher Nolan way of movie. I was disappointed to look at the music that Hans Zimmer has produced and I was so worried that Christopher Nolan, brother of Jonathan Nolan, could not create any impact on my situation at that time. Thank you.I would like to talk about a very difficult decision I have taken in my life. I was asked to come abroad from my company regarding one of the client's work.

I would like to talk about Jackie Chan. I know I have to talk about a famous athlete, but I still consider Jackie Chan as a famous athlete because whatever movies that he has so far acted on, all those movies he has broken at least one of his bones and he has achieved, he has won Oscar awards, many Oscar awards and I admire his dedication and hard work.
He doesn't know English in the first half of his life and he was only acting on Japanese movies, then he started acting on Hollywood movies as well. Because of his activeness and achievement, he was able to get world famous. I still admire him in his late 50s and 60s; he was able to perform many stunts.
I still remember there was a movie where he fought with Bruce Lee and he broke his elbow. I admire his hard work and I still like for what he is. I have watched a movie called Rush Hour which I still remember today and even now if I am depressed sometimes I will go and watch his movies. He always acts in a way that is jovial and funny to even youngsters.
He was the first person who has changed the fighting genre into a comedy genre in real life movies and I am thankful that Jackie Chan has dedicated his life to cinema. Thank you.
I would like to share the experience I got when I visited my friend at their workplace. It happened last year where I went to visit my childhood friend named Hari Prasad.
First of all, let me talk about my friend. I have never met him for over 15 years and he is a childhood friend. We always cycled together and went to our school. He studied biochemistry and he went to a gene modification industry, and he is currently working with one of the genetic companies.
I went to his workplace and I saw that he is given more respect and he is in a well-noted position. I was happy to see him grow, and after 15 years, it was like a dream come true when I met him. All the childhood memories I had so far flashed in a second, and looking at him in the most respectable position made me wonder how life has changed in this past 15 years.
I was so excited and we shared lunch together. We were making some fun notes about how life has changed and how instead of roaming around on bicycles, we are now with cars and big workplaces and great positions. Within 15 years, all these things have happened, and we were just recalling all those memories and having a good time.I would like to talk about Jackie Chan.

I would like to talk about the most important thing that I did learn in my life, that is meditation. I learned it through various efforts from my side. I have got to this place through some YouTube videos and some books.
I initially struggled with ulcer and there was some mental stress and psychological stress which I had earlier and I was asked to, asked by many doctors to quit my job and I was hesitant about it because the only thing that I love is my job, was my job actually, right now I love myself.
I started thinking why I am getting stressed and then I understood that thoughts are the reasons why I was stressed and I started thinking about myself and coming about an idea again, a thought to somehow manage this stress. Then I understood thoughts are something that we always get and whatever we are getting out of thought is always the things that we already know. So if we know something then only those data we will be getting again from thoughts.
So it is far better that we can avoid this thought by just ideally thinking or maybe being idle without even using any words and at some point I understood that someone else is talking to us, that is what we call as thought. So maybe instead of listening to this person maybe we can just stop avoiding the words.
So that is where I conclude. Thank you.
I am a software developer and I would like to tell you about the time when I used my imagination to build a product that I used in my hackathon. It was last year January. I tried to participate in the hackathon that was organized in my organization.
I was asked to create a product that is not something that I use in my day-to-day developer activities. So me and my team came up with an idea where the users can go ahead and create their own test cases and capture the screen and record some events that happened inside their website.
And we were discussing about this idea for over 3-4 days and we came up with some outstanding idea where QA developers and solution analysts can perform these operations and the developers can go ahead and find whatever the QA and all the other product owners has done in the application.
When we were thinking about these ideas we had our discussions regarding these new features that we can bring to the product and once we started building this one of the features where we can record the screen, we came up with capturing all the Redux and other actions as well and recreate whatever the QA and other product owners have done.
And we won the hackathon actually and we were so happy and excited that we can release some other versions as well along with this.I would like to talk about the most important thing that I did learn in my life, that is meditation.

First, let me explain to you about some of my qualities. I have never cooked in my life until last year. I always depend on some other persons, either my parents or my wife, regarding cooking, and they will always provide me the food. I was asked to stay away from my family for a year regarding my on-site opportunity that I got from my company, and since I don't know cooking, the most important advice that I got from my parents is to cook and eat.
I always go to hotels and have my food, but I happened to stay with a roommate who was also studying in Canada. He always wakes up in the morning at 6 and cooks his own food every day, and he takes care of his body in a great manner. I was inspired by this guy, and I started learning to cook from him. I was happy that I was able to grasp the cooking skill quickly. I started with boiling rice and stuff and helping him at some time, and slowly migrated all the work from him to me. I started building a good reputation for my cooking skills, and I was able to cook for 6-7 people at once, thanks to that guy.
I would like to talk about a drawing which impressed me in my childhood. I and my dad had many arguments and we never were in sync with each other at any point before this happened. I always saw my father as a hard person and he will never be sharing anything with me; that is what my perspective was.
One day I saw one of my dad's old notebooks where he drew a picture of Hanuman, which is a Hindu God that is very powerful and has great physique. I have never seen such a beautiful drawing of any person or thing till that point, and I was very impressed that my dad was able to create such an artistic piece of work. I saw that as an inspiration and I was inspired; I started drawing. I was thinking if my dad can do it, then somewhere inside my genes something should be present that I myself can do. I took that as an inspiration and I was able to create massive pieces of art after that.
Nowadays, people call modern art as something that they can splash some paints and call that as art, but I still feel like all the ancient temples and all the other things which can withstand all the thunders and still stand the earthquakes and thunders stand till now is the real piece of art.
Thank you.
I am going to talk about an important decision that I have made in my life. I am a software developer and I have 8 years of experience. I had to choose between my family and my work profession last year and I chose my work profession and I left my family behind and went to on-site opportunity for a year.
I have a daughter and a brother as well and I had to miss my entire family: my parents, my wife, my child, and my brother for a period of one year. I have never cooked in my life before that point and I had to prepare and take care of myself, which I have never done so far, and that was a very hard decision at that time. Everybody from very old people like all the elderly people in my family asked me not to go there apart from my parents and with my personal family's push I was able to take that decision and I went to Canada.
I was able to earn a lot, 3-4 folds of whatever I am getting in India and I was able to close my home loan and all the other loans as well. I brought my brother as well, where he is going to study cyber security in Canada. I still feel that while taking this decision it was a hard decision but now looking back I am very happy that I have taken that decision and I will still take the same decision if I had to do it again.
So, yeah, thank you.
I am going to talk about snake. It looks like a thread and it lives inside the burrows and near rabbit holes. Why it is interesting is because it always is a unique creature where no other creature that has any mammal or any other reptiles does not have a structure that the snake has. It looks like an S shape but it does not have any legs and it still can be called as the king of the reptiles.
One particular case is the cobra one where it does not eat any other thing other than apart from the snakes. It seems like it needs a separate confidence that no other mammal or any other animal has. It has to devise its own path of movement where it cannot mimic anything that has legs and still it has the venom and it has the confidence to survive in the nature.
I have seen it multiple times in my previous years where I have seen the snake at very close distance and still it has not done any harm to me but still I am scared of it and I still remember that in my dreams there are multiple days where I could not sleep.
An interesting place that I visited recently is Canada. I went there on a work visa. My company hired me through an internal company transfer and I had to work there. I was working from home even when I was in Canada. Since the timezone was the same as their client, I had to go there and work there.
I have always worked and lived in hotter climates than whatever I saw in Canada. Canada is too cold; it is like minus 30 degrees, and whatever day-to-day activities that we have here will not match once we go there. I had to rethink every single thing from bathing to eating and all the other diets and stuff.
I also did not know how to cook, so I had to learn that there, and that was a great opportunity for me to be alone and understand what my differences were. I am still thankful for the opportunity that was given by my company. Whatever we had so far in our life will change once we change our climate. Even our thoughts and moods will change.
So that was a great opportunity, and I still want to stay there and understand the climate more and maybe probably live there for some time so I can still be happy.
I would like to talk about a historical place which we visited as a family and I still have goosebumps when I think about this interesting place. It is Thanjavur temple. It is somewhere in middle of Tamil Nadu which is southern district in India and we, my family, me, myself, my wife, my daughter, my parents, my brother, we all went to this place through car and we were traveling for 8 hours.
I had already learned about this place through my history book that it has 80 ton rock sitting on at around 20 feet height and they have created all these things like all the architecture and all the exciting structures have already been designed and built in 7th, 9th century and I was wondering what technology they used to come up with such a brilliant structure.
The temple is so big that here there are multiple elephants used to, there were multiple elephants used to build this up and the most interesting part of the temple is the magnetic field and also the position in which the temple has been built.
Every few years the earth plates will move and it will create some humps, height and then some depths as well in some places and one such place is this Nandi. There is a cow which is kept there and based on the movement of these rocks, this Nandi, this cow will, made of rock, a very big cow that is made of 8 ton rock and it still grows.
I would like to explain you about a situation where I was frustrated by a lot of noise from my neighborhood. I was married and I was just married and sleeping peacefully in my room with my wife, and I heard this large noise from beside my home. I went there to see who these lunatics were, and I had to scold them and go around and call the cops.
I was very frustrated because I didn't have my sleep, and it was very frustrating for me to handle my work life and my personal life at that time, which was not the problem with the other persons. They have stopped the music and everything was chilled out after that time, but it was a very difficult experience for me because of the frustration that I had earlier and the stress that I was not able to handle.
Then I realized that it was not the problem from the noise, but it was my internal problem with my mind and my thoughts. I had to dedicate my own personal time so that I can enjoy with my family as well and avoid getting tensed for any small issues. Right now, I can tolerate a lot of things, but at that time it was very difficult for me to cope with my anger issues. Thank you.
I would like to talk about the person who has welcomed me into a team. The person's name is Ina Nazareth and I had eight years of experience when I joined my company. The team that I joined was not very good and whatever work they were doing was not satisfying for me, so I had to move to a different team.
So I asked this person Ina Nazareth about the team that she was working on and she was very welcoming. She helped me in getting to know about the new team and I was very hesitant about meeting the other persons in the team because I don't know them. She always welcomes everyone whoever is in the team to be happy and active.
I have never met any person who is super friendly like her. She always cares about our personal things. Even if there are some bugs which are very difficult to solve, there are some times where I will be able to talk to her regarding that and she will be guiding me in some situations where it is very difficult to manage.
She has a very good rapport with any new person as well, whoever is joining the team.
I would like to describe you about a very noisy place that I have recently been to. I can give you a background on why it was noisy. It was a casual event that happened in Merino Mall, but I felt it to be very noisy because I was staying in Canada for one year and it was very quiet there. You won't be able to find some cheerful people having some party over there. It was very quiet and you won't be able to hear any 10 decibel sound as well there.
And I came back last December and I was meeting my family and it was too emotional. And I had to take my family to somewhere out, so we decided to go to a shopping mall where we might purchase some items and have some fun and games around there with my 2 year old daughter. We were going by a car and once we reached there, I was finding a parking. Once I was able to park my vehicle, I found that there was a new festival going on in that particular mall where they are cheering and finding out new people and then they were dancing and having fun around.
I was very happy to see that event, but unfortunately I was trained in a way that is very quiet and peaceful for one year. Since I was very naive to the noise, I felt like it was very irritating. Immediately I went back to my car and we decided to go to beach instead of staying there. But right now my nerves are calmed down and I was able to cope up.
Let me explain you about the time when I used a paper map. I was 12 years old and I had to go to one of my neighbor's relatives function in one of the most astonishing areas in our hometown. It was a gated community which was the first in my hometown and I don't know how to go there. I was accompanied by one of my friends and we were roaming around the place trying to find the new home where the function was happening.
We both were given an invitation which had a map and since we were very new to that area, we were almost getting lost. That was the first time I was given a map. The map had some four or five roads and there I was navigating. There was one of the places called Maharishi School, and I was able to see that in the text inside the paper. When I looked at real life, I was able to find the Maharishi School and I was very happy that this is how we will be navigating maps.
That was the first time that I was able to navigate a map. I went there along with my friend and we were finally able to figure out where the real function was happening. We arrived there a little bit late, but still, we arrived and we were happily enjoying it.
I'm going to describe a garden that is present beside my home in Canada, Scarborough in Canada particularly. I usually visit that when in some 15 days once I'll go there. Bi-weekly I'll be going there and roaming around for some time.
Initially I landed there on December and I was not able to see this beauty because everything was covered in snow. I have never gone, I don't even know that this park existed at that time. I went there and just saw the snow that is deposited on the trees and some broken branches on the trees were there and I was just feeling the cold air and ran away to my home thinking that this park is of no use to me and it won't even give me any relaxations.
After three months there was a spring season and I was able to see all the leaves and trees, all the flowers with different colors. I was so excited to see that there are too many children roaming around there having fun playing some games and adults who are playing some golf and other things as well along with these children. Every tree has its own different color with different trees with different leaves and flowers and I was feeling something like it was a must-see place to be.
So I have never seen a park that is so colorful and in some three months it will again become snow. So that is kind of the nature that is revealing itself through this park, that is what I felt when I just saw that.
I would like to explain you about the time where I picked up a watch that does not belong to me. I was 12 years old and I was roaming around near my home and there was a bus seat that was beside my home and I found a watch and it was a working watch that was in working condition. I always had my watches in that age and since that was my most lovable possession at that time, I took it and kept it with me. I was wearing it every 24 hours and I never even removed it from my hand ever since.
One day I was going around in my cycle and I was caught by one of my neighbours and they were asking that this was the watch that they lost. He was very scared and I tried to run but they caught me and handed me over to my parents. The whole family was scolding me that I should never be doing something like that. I told my mom that if they had provided me with a watch I would never have stolen and she gave me a slap and told me that I have to earn for the things that I want to own.
That was a great life advice that I got that day which I didn't know on that day that it would create a very massive change inside me and kept me going all these years towards earning money. Thank you.
I would like to explain you about the practical skills that I have recently learned, which is cooking. I want to give you a background on my skills first. I have never cooked in my life so far until last year. I was asked to go to an on-site opportunity and I had to be away from my family. So I was forced to learn cooking.
I think cooking is a very important personal skill that any individual should have. I was having an ulcer and I was not in a good shape regarding my physical health, and once I learned cooking, I understood what has to be taken up and why I have to be eating non-spicy foods and all the other cooking-related steps. I was able to learn, and it was amazing that cooking involves only four things:
- Sautéing
- Frying
- Boiling
- Baking
So I was getting mastery of boiling first, so I could boil rice and eat for a day. Then I slowly improved to make all the Indian dishes like sambar, rasam, and all these things, poriyal as well to be healthy with vegetables.
So usually in the morning, I would be able to finish the cooking by 9 o'clock and go to work at 9 to 5, and come back home and prepare for the other day's food. So this was my routine, and I still think that cooking should be a great thing.
I would like to describe you about a skill which I learnt when I was 13 years old. The skill is selling anything that I have in my pocket.
I was brought up by my aunt and she was in a very poor state when I was young. She lost her job, so she was doing a manufacturing business where she used to sell food products. It was very hard for her to manufacture those products and sell that as well.
I was very young and I was very active as well, so I challenged my aunt that I would be able to sell the products that she manufactures. I took some 17 packets and went around my hometown and sold it to everyone. I was able to successfully sell all the products, and from that time I was able to sell anything that I have with me.
I was so happy and delighted that I was able to do this very easily; it comes naturally to me. So I was very happy and I never left that skill alone. I still want to continue selling the products and never lose that skill because I know that freelancing or doing anything in this world is selling something to someone to earn money.
So I think that is the most important skill that everyone should have. Thank you.
I would like to explain you about a situation where I was very exhausted and I had to do a lot of things in a very short time. It happened in Soho where I was working about six years ago and that was my second company and I was very new to the technology that I was currently working on. I am a software developer and I was working on creating a website and there was a project deadline where we will be releasing a new version of the product and that is going to be launched on Monday.
On Friday evening, we came to know that there was an issue with one of the colleagues reporting to me and I had to fix that as soon as possible. The product release was on Monday and I was very frustrated. I had to deal with all the clients as well and assess the risk while pushing the changes to the server. I had to talk to all the other developers and other team members to get to know the root cause of the issue. I was able to fix it and we were able to launch the product on time.
I was very frustrated and very tired actually after completing that job, and I took a week's leave and went to my hometown to enjoy the beautiful scenery. I have never worked that tiring in my entire life so far. Thank you.
I would like to describe you about a situation where I had to teach my daughter how to sit on a cot. She was very small and she was always around me. I was sitting on the cot and she just looked at me and she tried to sit there which she tried at one year old. When she was one year old and I was so delighted to teach her how to sit.
So I took her and showed her that you have to:
1. Keep two hands on the cot.
2. Put one more leg on top of the cot.
3. Push your body to the top.
4. Push through your legs and pull through your hands.
5. You will be able to get three fourth of your body on top of the cot.
6. Use the other leg to bring the entire body on top of the cot.
Then I had to teach her how to get down as well so she will be able to:
- Turn herself around.
- Keep one leg down.
- Keep the other one as well and run away.
When she learned that she was able to do that she was very happy and hugged me a lot of times. She immediately forgot on the next day how to climb and she again came back to me hugging my leg and asking me that how will she be able to climb the cot again. So I taught her again and from that time she has never forgotten how to climb a cot and I am so happy that I was able to teach her a very simple task but still this is a day-to-day activity for us. But for children, it is such a great achievement that they have done and I am very happy that I was able to teach her. Thank you.
I will explain you about the experience which is new and completely different to me. Just to give you a background, I went to Canada last year in Burkvisa and I was working there for a year and I came back now.
The experience that I am going to share with you is the cold that I experienced. I would say that it's an extreme cold that I have experienced so far in my life. I went to Canada on January last year and I was in the flight and once the flight has landed I went out of the aerodrome. Once I was standing, I was able to see the sun just like in India and I was so excited that all these people, whoever has said that Canada's climate is very cold, I was thinking no, these people are lying since the sun is so bright and shiny, I thought the temperature also would be the same with India's exposure, I thought this is how it is going to be.
And once I stepped outside of the aerodrome, I found that within 30 seconds, I was shivering and all the cold air, whatever was blowing there went straight into my ears and I was blown away by the extreme cold. So I ran back into the aerodrome again and this was an experience which I cannot predict or think about in my entire life since I did not even wear any jacket or any cotton to the ears, I was completely exposed to the cold and I got a fever for a week once I landed there and I had to go to a hospital and figure it out what the problem is and then fix it.
